# Voting Bloc - Flutter Movie Voting App

Created for a project at school. Unfortunately the server it connected to is no longer in service.

One user would start a session, and the other would enter the code from the generated session. They would then swipe left or right until both swiped right on the same movie. Then, a pop-up would display on both devices, showing the chosen movie.
